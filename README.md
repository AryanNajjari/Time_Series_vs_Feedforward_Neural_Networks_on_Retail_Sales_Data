# Feedforward-vs-Time-Series-Neural-Networks-on-Retail-Sales-Data
This project investigates whether modeling retail data as a time series improves the prediction of total profit. Using a dataset of approximately 100,000 retail transactions, I compare feedforward neural networks with time-series neural networks such as LSTM.
Despite the temporal ordering of transactions, experimental results show that a feedforward model achieves lower MAE than time-series models.
